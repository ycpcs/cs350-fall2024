### Course Description

This course is an in-depth examination of important data structures, their algorithms, and implementation techniques. Both abstract and concrete data structures are discussed including sequences, stacks, queues, maps, sets, graphs, array lists, linked lists, skip lists, search trees, heaps, and hash tables. Students will implement and apply the data structures through a series of programming assignments.


**Prerequisites:**	CS201 with a grade of 2.0 or higher<br>
**Credit:**		3 credit hours<br>
**Text:** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;_**No Required Text**_ <br>
&emsp;&emsp;**Optional:** [Open Data Structures (in C++) by Pat Morin](http://www.opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp.pdf)<br>

### Course Structure and Expectations

Class meetings will be primarily a discussion of various data structure operations and implementations. It is important to come to class prepared to ask questions related to the topic and/or work on practice exercises which are designed to illustrate the concepts from the lecture notes. There will be a series of programming assignments in the C++ programming language at approximately 1-2 week intervals, to be completed individually.

There will be regular in-class reading quizzes, programming assignments, and four exams.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

  - understand the operations on fundamental abstract data structures such as sequences, stacks, queues, sets, and maps
  - understand the operations and basic algorithms for concrete data structures such as array lists, linked lists, skip lists, trees, search trees (including balanced search trees), hash tables, heaps, and graphs.
  - implement a variety of data structures using C++
  - apply data structures to various computational problems
  - choose appropriate data structures for a given computational problem based on efficiency considerations

| &lt; 60           |    0     |

<br>

**No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided.** All exams will be closed book.

You must receive a score of 70+ on _at least one exam_ to earn a passing grade for the course.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments are posted on the course schedule. **You are expected to do the reading before class**. Class time will be for asking questions about parts of the reading you did not fully understand.  Reading quizzes will be given at the start of each class period on the topic of your reading assignment.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments will consist of implementing and/or applying the various data structures discussed in class. Collaboration on programming assignments is encouraged, but each student must submit their own solutions that demonstrate their understanding of the material.

**You MUST make a legitimate attempt to complete every programming assignment. I reserve the right to fail any student who does not make a good faith effort to complete all of the programming assignments. Failure to complete and submit two or more programming assignments by their assigned due date will result is a zero for the course.**

Late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than three (3) days late.**

Programs will be primarily graded on proper functionality based on a provided interface specification.

### In-Class Labs and Activities

Throughout the semester, a series of in-class labs and activities will be distributed. These labs and activities are designed to help you better understand the various data structures and programming techniques that we will discuss throughout the semester.  These in-class labs and activities are not graded and need not be submitted.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



### Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and read the appropriate text material prior to class. If you must miss a class, it is your responsibility to notify the professor prior to class. Students are responsible for all material covered in class. No make-up quizzes will be given.

You may work ahead and submit any assignments **early**, but you **must not** fall behind. Class time is intended to be used for answering questions about the reading, labs, and assignments. You are responsible for keeping up with the reading assignments as described in the schedule.

### Classroom Etiquette

While in class, you are expected to act in a professional manner and be respectful of **all** those around you. Examples of unacceptable classroom behaviors include, but are not limited to:
* excessive talking
* interrupting or speaking over colleagues
* using profanity and/or other inappropriate language
* making derogatory remarks
* making inappropriate jokes
* singing, humming, or other distracting noises

If you fail to abide by these standards you may be asked to leave for the remainder of the class period.

### Academic Integrity

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty member then has ten business days from that written notification to the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty, unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.
