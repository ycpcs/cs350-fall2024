### Getting Started

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Download [CS350_Lab05.zip](CS350_Lab05.zip).  Unzip it.  
In a terminal window, change directory to the **```CS350_Lab05```** directory.

Using CLion (or some lame text editor), open the file **```main.cpp```**.

To compile the test program, either compile within CLion or run the command **```make```** at the command line.

To run the test program, either press the PLAY button in CLion, or run the command **```./lab05```** at the commend line.

### Your Task

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Complete the program in **```main.cpp```** so that it stores the sequence of integer values entered by the user in 
a linked list.

Note that in this lab, you will create a "bare" linked list
consisting of **```Node```** objects.  You will use a **```head```** pointer to keep track of the first node in the 
linked list, and (for the first two milestones) a **```tail```** pointer to keep track of the last node in the linked list.

*All of the code manipulating the linked list should be in the* **```main```** *function.*  For this lab, you will not 
implement the linked list operations using functions/methods.  The idea is to focus on the low-level manipulation of 
the links that connect the nodes in the list.

**IMPORTANT:** Recall that any object you create in C++, you must also destroy.  For each milestone, write the code
necessary to delete all objects from memory.  Be sure to use **valgrind** to verify that you have no memory leaks.

The **```Node```** type, in its simplest form, is defined as follows:

```cpp
class Node {
public:
    explicit Node(int v) : value(v), next(nullptr) { }
    int value;
    Node *next;
};
```

There are three milestones.  **Important**: after you complete each
milestone, **save a copy of** **```main.cpp```**.  For example, after completing milestone 1, save your work in a file called **```main_ms1.cpp```**.

### Milestone 1

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Store each integer value entered by the user in the linked list.
Each node in the list should store one value.

After the user has entered the sequence of values, the program
should print the values in order.

Example run (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Enter integer values (-1 to end):
<b>9</b>
<b>0</b>
<b>1</b>
<b>2</b>
<b>5</b>
<b>-1</b>
Here are your values:
9
0
1
2
5
</pre>



<br>

#### Hints

**```head```** should always point to the first node in the list, and **```tail```** should always point to the last 
node in the list.

Think about how the empty list should be represented.  Setting
both **```head```** and **```tail```** to **```nullptr```** when the list is empty is the most straightforward approach.

To traverse the list in order to print the values, use a **```Node```**\* variable as the loop variable.  On the first
iteration of the loop, the variable should point to the first node in the list.  At the end of each iteration of the
loop, the variable should advance so that it points to the next node in the list.  Think about how to express a loop 
condition that will terminate the loop when there are no more nodes to traverse.

### Milestone 2

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

For the second milestone:

* use a doubly-linked list
* in addition to printing the values in order, also print them in reverse order

Example run (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Enter integer values (-1 to end):
<b>9</b>
<b>0</b>
<b>1</b>
<b>2</b>
<b>5</b>
<b>-1</b>
Here are your values:
9
0
1
2
5
Here are your values, reversed:
5
2
1
0
9
</pre>



<br>

#### Hints

You will need to add a **```prev```** field to the **```Node```** class.

When adding a node to the list, make sure that the **```prev```** field of the inserted node points to the old 
tail node (if any).

Iterating backwards through a doubly-linked list is very
similar to iterating forward, except

* start at the end (tail), and
* follow the **```prev```** links instead of the **```next```** links



<br>

### Milestone 3

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

For the third milestone:

* get rid of the **```tail```** pointer
* use a single dummy (sentinel) node (create a new node with a data value of 0)
* implement a circular doubly-linked list
* initially, the sentinel node should point back to itself

This is the doubly-linked list representation that you will use in [Assignment 2](../assign/assign02.html).
