title: "Assignment 7: Binary Heap"
---


<br>

This assignment will implement a binary heap that stores arbitrary objects via class templates. The heap will use a templated 
array backing structure whose size will be dynamically adjusted depending on the size of the heap being stored.


<br>

### Getting Started

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

If you don't already have one, create a directory on your **H:** drive named **CS350** (or anywhere else you choose). 
Navigate into this new directory and create a subdirectory named **assignments**.

Download [BinHeap.zip](BinHeap.zip), saving it into the **assignments** directory. 

Double-click on **BinHeap.zip** and extract the contents of the archive into a subdirectory called **BinHeap**.

For this assignment, a static library has been provided (containing working versions of each method) to allow for testing of 
each class method independently. Any unimplemented methods in **BinHeap.cpp** will use the corresponding method from 
the library, thus you can implement the methods in any order. Be sure to test each method you implement individually 
against the library for proper operation which can be accomplished by uncommenting the appropriate **```#define```** 
in the file **Flags.h** (and commenting the **```#define ALL 1```**). 
**DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE OTHER ```.h``` FILES INCLUDED WITH THE ASSIGNMENT**.

The class declaration is 

```cpp
	template <class T>
	class BinHeap
	{
	public:
		// Constructor, destructor
		BinHeap();
		~BinHeap();
		
		// Public interface
		void buildHeap(const T* arr, int size);
		void insert(const T & x);
		T removeMin();
		void makeEmpty();
		void printHeap();

		// (Private) fields
		T* heapArray;
		int maxSize;
		int heapSize;
		
		// (Private) utility methods
		bool isEmpty();
		int leftChildIndex(int idx);
		int rightChildIndex(int idx);
		int parentIndex(int idx);
		void percolateUp(int idx);
		void percolateDown(int idx);
		void resizeArray(int newSize);
	};
```

For this implementation, **```maxSize```** is the maximum size *heap* that the backing array can accomodate (**not** 
including the sentinel value) while **```heapSize```** is the actual number of elements currently in the *heap*.



<br>

### 1. Constructor / Destructor

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Since the backing array will change dynamically as needed, the constructor should simply allocate an initial backing 
array for a heap that can hold 1 element and set the two size fields appropriately. Remember, no elements are stored 
in the 0th index of the backing array.  The destructor will then need to deallocate the backing array.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to **```BinHeap()```** (in **BinHeap.cpp**) to dynamically allocate a backing array of **```T```** 
  elements with sufficient size for a single element heap. Be sure to also initialize the two size fields in the class 
  accordingly. Since the heap indicies start at 1, set a sentinel value of -1 into the 0 index element of the backing 
  array. Hint: Consider how many elements you need to initially allocate to accomodate both the sentinel value and one 
  heap element. 

  - Add code to **```~BinHeap()```** (in **BinHeap.cpp**) to deallocate the backing array (note this will remove all 
  the elements automatically).



<br>

### 2. IsEmpty()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

A private method which simply returns a boolean indicating whether or not the current *heap* contains any valid elements.
	
**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```isEmpty()```** method that takes no parameters and returns a **```bool```** indicating *true* 
  if the heap contains no elements. Hint: This check should not be dependent on the size of the *backing array*.



<br>

### 3. MakeEmpty()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

This utility method should simply remove all the existing elements in the heap.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```makeEmpty()```** to remove all the elements from the heap. Hint: This can easily be done by 
  simply deallocating the existing backing array and then reallocating a new backing array similar to in the constructor.



<br>

### 4. ResizeArray()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

This utility method will simply allocate a new backing array and copy the *valid* elements from the old heap into the 
new array.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```resizeArray()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter representing the new size for 
  the largest heap the backing array can store (the **```int```** parameter is NOT the size of the new backing array). 
  It should copy the *valid* elements from the current heap's backing array and then *deallocate* the old backing array. 
  Hint: Remember that the 0th index of the backing array does not store a heap element.  Also, remember to update the 
  new maximal heap size of the new backing array in the appropriate class field (note the size of the *heap* should 
  not change).



<br>

### 5. LeftChildIndex() / RightChildIndex() / ParentIndex()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Since we are representing the heap using an array, the indices for the left child, right child, and parent nodes for a given node 
are simple computations. Recall from class that:

```cpp
leftChild(i) = 2*i
	
rightChild(i) = 2*i + 1
	
parent(i) = i/2
```

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```leftChildIndex()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter for the index of an input node 
  and returns an **```int```** for the index of the left child of the input node. You may assume that the parameter 
  represents a valid index value in the heap.

  - Add code to the **```rightChildIndex()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter for the index of an input node 
  and returns an **```int```** for the index of the right child of the input node. You may assume that the parameter 
  represents a valid index value in the heap.

  - Add code to the **```parentIndex()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter for the index an input node 
  and returns an **```int```** for the index of the parent of the input node. You may assume that the parameter 
  represents a valid index value in the heap.



<br>

### 6. MinChild()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

For a min-heap represented with a backing array, it is convenient to have a utility method that can determine the index 
of a node's minimum child.  This method will be useful for **```percolateDown()```**.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```minChild()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter for the index of an input node and 
  returns an **```int```** for the index of the minimum child of the input node. If the input node has no children, then 
  return -1.  You may assume that the parameter represents a valid index value in the heap.



<br>

### 7. Insert() / PercolateUp()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

To insert a new element into a heap, we can simply place it at the index of the backing array *after* the last valid 
heap element, and then *percolate up* this element.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```percolateUp()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter of the index of the current 
  node. The method should continue to swap the element with its parent as long as the value of the parent is *greater than* 
  the value of the node (or the node reaches the top of the heap). 

  - Add code to the **```insert()```** method that takes a **```const```** reference to a **```T```** object as a 
  parameter. The method should place the element into the backing array and percolate it up the heap. Hint: If the 
  backing array is full when trying to insert the new element, *double* the size of the backing array *before* inserting 
  the new element (consider using the **```resizeArray()```** method). 



<br>

### 8. RemoveMin() / PercolateDown()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Removing elements from a heap is straightforward since the minimum element is *guaranteed* to be the *top* element of 
the heap. However, removing this element will then leave a hole in the heap that needs to be percolated down to the 
bottom. One way of doing this is to simply *swap* the top element with the *last* valid element in the heap (decrementing 
the size of the heap) and then percolating down this new top element which will restore the heap properties.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```percolateDown()```** method that takes an **```int```** parameter of the index of the current 
  node. The method should continually swap the node with the *smaller* of its two children until the node is either 
  smaller than (or equal to) *both* children or at the *bottom* of the heap.  Hint: To determine which child node is 
  smaller, consider using the **```minChild()```** method.

  - Add code to the **```removeMin()```** method that takes no parameters and returns a **```T```** object from the top 
  of the heap (or -1 if there is no minimum element). The method should swap the top element (to be deleted) with the 
  last *valid* element in the heap (if there is one) and then percolate the new top element down the heap. Hint: If the 
  size of the *reduced* heap is less than a *third* of the backing array (i.e. **```(heapSize < maxSize/3.0)```**), the 
  backing array should be cut in *half* (consider using the resizeArray() method).



<br>

### 9. BuildHeap()

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

This public method will construct a heap from a given array of elements. Hence it will need to copy the elements from 
the parameter into the backing array (resizing the backing array appropriately) and then build a heap from the backing 
array.

**Tasks**

  - Add code to the **```buildHeap()```** method that takes a **```const T```** array parameter and the **```int```** 
  size of this array (since C++ arrays do not have a size method). Size the backing array appropriately (consider using 
  the **```resizeArray()```** method) such that the heap matches the size of the parameter array, copy the elements into 
  the backing array, and then build the heap using the **```percolateDown()```** method. Hint: Remember that the 
  elements in the array parameter begin at 0 while the valid heap elements in the backing array should begin at 1.



<br>

### 10. Compiling and running the program

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Once you have completed implementing any of the above methods (the remaining unimplemented methods will be drawn from the 
static library):

**In CLion:**  
From the "Run" menu, select "Run" (or click the "Run" button in the top right of the IDE)

**In the terminal:**  
Navigate to the directory containing the source files and run the command **```make```** to compile.

Run the command **```./BinHeap```**.

Congratulations, you have just implemented an binary heap C++ data structure with templates!



<br>
    
### 11. Testing your data structure
    
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
    
The test program that is distributed with this programming assignment (**```tests.cpp```**) includes a variety of 
tests to verify the functionality of your newly created data structure.  However, the tests that are included with 
this assignment are not necessarily extensive and may not test all of the edge cases for your data structure. 

Part of developing any piece of software is creating the tests required to ensure correctness.  You should 
add any tests necessary to ensure complete correctness of your data structure. A good place to start is to
consider edge cases:

 - What happens when each method is called on an empty data structure?
 - What happens when each method is called on a full data structure?
 - What happens when each method is called on a data structure that has a single element?
 
**Be assured, that when your programming assignment is graded these edge cases (and more) will be tested.**

The testing framework used in **```tests.cpp```** in called [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch). 
Documentation can be found on the [Catch website](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch).

### 12. Checking for memory leaks
    
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
    
Memory leaks are the result of memory that is allocated but not properly freed.  In C++, each
time you use the **```new```** keyword you are allocating memory.  All instances of **```new```** 
should have a corresponding instance of **```delete```** to free the memory that was allocated.
This can be trickier than it sounds. Thankfully, there are tools such as [**```valgrind```**](http://valgrind.org) 
that can automatically analyze your program and detect these types of errors.

To check your program for memory leaks, 

**In CLion:**  
From the "Run" menu, select "Run ... with Valgrind Memcheck" (or click the "Memcheck" button in the top right of the IDE)

**In the terminal:**  
Navigate to the directory containing the source files and run the command **```make memcheck```** from the command line.

Fix any memory leaks that are detected.
